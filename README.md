ProxySQL Container
==================

To bootstrap this container with the proper replication hostgroup configuration, a bit of hackery is needed
until https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/issues/648 is resolved.

The process involves running a donor container, setting the replication hostgroup config as you want it, then copying
the sqlite3 database file out of the container then modifying the tables so we can use it as a seed database for the
actual runtime container.

First, run your donor container:
```
docker run --name proxysql_donor -d -p 6032:6032 perconalab/proxysql
```

Next, connect to the admin interface and set up your hostgroup configuration:
```
INSERT INTO mysql_replication_hostgroups VALUES (0,1);
SAVE MYSQL SERVERS TO DISK;
```

Then, copy the sqlite3 database file out of the running donor container:
```
docker cp `docker ps | grep proxysql_donor | awk '{print $1}'`:/var/lib/proxysql/proxysql.db .
```

Finally, use sqlite3 to drop all tables except for the mysql_replication_hostgroups table:
```
sqlite3 proxysql.db

drop table global_variables;
drop table mysql_collations;
drop table mysql_query_rules;
drop table mysql_servers;
drop table mysql_users;
drop table scheduler;
.quit
```

Once you've modified the proxysql.db as noted above, it can be used as a seed for the running configuration that is created when
starting the container generated by this repository's Dockerfile.

The configuration included herein was used for testing purposes, and you would use this in a production environment with either a
bind mounted proxysql.cnf (`-v /path/to/your/proxysql.cnf:/proxysql/proxysql.cnf`) or a k8s Secret that has been created from a valid
configuration file, then mounted as a volume at `/etc/proxysql.cnf` in your pod.

To run this container interactively, build and run with an entrypoint of `ash`:

```
docker build -t my-alpine-proxysql-build .
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint ash my-alpine-proxysql-build
```
